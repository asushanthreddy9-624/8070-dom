# Step 1: Model the Problem
What data types do we need to use to represent the information that the application needs
* Contact Lists need a contact
    * Contact needs salutation, first name, middle name (optional), last name, email, contact number
* Create a `data.js` and put the mock data inside
* All functionalities pertaining data will be inside the `data.js`

# Step 2: Render List
* In your html, do a mockup of how the list will look like (radio buttons? tables?)
* In your `script.js` define an entry point
* Identify which part of the HTML is dynamic (will change according to the user's interaction) and make it easy to select
